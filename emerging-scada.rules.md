Name : **ICONICS WebHMI ActiveX Stack Overflow** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : ActiveX controls are Microsoft Internet Explorerâ€™s native version of plug-ins and can be leveraged by non browse applications as well..  ActiveX provides web application developers a facility to execute code on a client machine through the web browser.  Unfortunately, ActiveX controls have been a significant source of security problems both due to vulnerabilities in the ActiveX control itself, in the browser which can allow the activeX control to bypass security, as well as the fact that it has extensive capabilities to attacker drive code.
ActiveX controls are very powerful and can be used for legitimate and nefarious purposes including monitoring your personal browsing habits, install malware, generate pop-ups, log your keystrokes and passwords, and do other malicious things. ActiveX controls are actually not Internet Explorer-only. They also work in other Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft Office. Other browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, all use other types of browser plug-ins. ActiveX controls only function in Internet Explorer. A website that requires an ActiveX control is an Internet Explorer-only website.
If you see these ActiveX controls alerts firing, they are unlikely to succeed in exploiting all but legacy windows systems running older versions of IE.  To help validate whether the signature is triggering a valid compromise you should look for other malicious signatures related to the client endpoint which is triggering.  This includes Exploit Kit, Malware, and Command and Control signatures, along with looking to see if the web server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **PROMOTIC ActiveX Control Insecure method (SaveCfg)** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : ActiveX controls are Microsoft Internet Explorerâ€™s native version of plug-ins and can be leveraged by non browse applications as well..  ActiveX provides web application developers a facility to execute code on a client machine through the web browser.  Unfortunately, ActiveX controls have been a significant source of security problems both due to vulnerabilities in the ActiveX control itself, in the browser which can allow the activeX control to bypass security, as well as the fact that it has extensive capabilities to attacker drive code.
ActiveX controls are very powerful and can be used for legitimate and nefarious purposes including monitoring your personal browsing habits, install malware, generate pop-ups, log your keystrokes and passwords, and do other malicious things. ActiveX controls are actually not Internet Explorer-only. They also work in other Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft Office. Other browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, all use other types of browser plug-ins. ActiveX controls only function in Internet Explorer. A website that requires an ActiveX control is an Internet Explorer-only website.
If you see these ActiveX controls alerts firing, they are unlikely to succeed in exploiting all but legacy windows systems running older versions of IE.  To help validate whether the signature is triggering a valid compromise you should look for other malicious signatures related to the client endpoint which is triggering.  This includes Exploit Kit, Malware, and Command and Control signatures, along with looking to see if the web server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.
