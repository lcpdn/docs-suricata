Name : **Possible Java Deployment Toolkit Launch Method Remote Code Execution Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Download of PDF With Compressed Flash Content** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Adobe Authplay.dll NewClass Memory Corruption Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Microsoft Internet Explorer Use-After-Free CVE-2013-3163** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Possible Phishing E-ZPass Email Toll Notification July 30 2014** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods. A whitepaper concerning modern phishing obfuscation methods can be found at https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Obfuscation-Techniques-In-Phishing-Attacks

Name : **DRIVEBY Social Engineering Toolkit Web Clone code detected** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures indicate that a malicious event has been observed, typically associated with exploit kits or watering hole attacks. This traffic occurs as legitimate activity on the part of the user, they are browsing a website which happens to either be compromised or loads malicious content which is embedded from a third party such as malvertizing. The user’s web browser and installed plugins  are then subjected to an exploit kit which attempts to compromise their system.

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures historically includes activity from many exploit kits, including but not limited to:

Angler
Archie
Blackhole
Crimepack
Flashpack / Critx
Goon/Infinity
Magnitude
NeoSploit
Nuclear
Redkit
SPL
Styx
Sweet Orange

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures also includes activity from many exploit kits observed in use by APT groups such as Sednit and Scanbox. Generic signatures are also included in this category of signatures which involved an unsuspecting user being subjected to browser and plugin exploits as a byproduct of normal web browsing activity.

In order to determine if a machine is compromised, or if the signature is an FP/FN, you should look at other signatures that fire against the client endpoint to determine if you see a chain of activity.  Typically if an exploit is successful you will see activity such as redirectors, landing pages, exploits, and ultimately command and control traffic.  Seeing only a driveby signature may indicate that the endpoint was attacked, but it may not be fully compromised.  You can further review the offending web servers in ET Intelligence for further validation to see if they have malicious reputation.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Internet Explorer execCommand function Use after free Vulnerability 0day Metasploit 2** 

Attack target : Client_and_Server

Description : The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development.
Its best-known project is the open source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.
The Metasploit Project is well known for its anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework (MSF).
Shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is called "shellcode" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.

These alerts will fire when shellcode known to be part of Metasploit Project is detected traversing the network. This indicates active use of Metasploit Framework, and it will fire very frequently during a penetration test. If you see only one or two alerts, it may indicate the attacker has copied the shellcode from Metasploit. There have been a few examples of its use in APT campaigns for persistence and lateral movement. 1,2

These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Chrome Extension Phishing HTTP Request** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **Tech Support Phone Scam Landing M1 Jul 7** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : This signature matches on common fields in tech support phone scam landing pages. These pages will pop up windows attempting to social engineer a user into calling the scammer to "fix their computer". They use simple javascript and html alert window techniques to prevent a user from leaving the page without killing the browser. As the rest of the attack occurs over the phone, there is usually no automated way to validate that the user has called the scammer without reaching out to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address

Name : **Tech Support Phone Scam Landing Jul 21 M2** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : This signature matches on common fields in tech support phone scam landing pages. These pages will pop up windows attempting to social engineer a user into calling the scammer to "fix their computer". They use simple javascript and html alert window techniques to prevent a user from leaving the page without killing the browser. As the rest of the attack occurs over the phone, there is usually no automated way to validate that the user has called the scammer without reaching out to the user.

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **Tech Support Phone Scam Landing Aug 12 M1** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point.

Name : **Microsoft Tech Support Scam M1 Sept 15 2016** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **Possible Phishing Verified by Visa title over non SSL Feb 17 2017** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

Name : **Possible Microsoft Internet Explorer CSS Tags Remote Code Execution Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Possible CVE-2017-0199 Activity Office Performing Discovery of Autolinked HTA.

The RIG Exploit Kit is a malware delivery framework, designed to  compromise targeted end-user client systems and install malware.  It first appeared in 2013 although it came from the Goon/Redkit/Sakura EK codebases. RIG EK is often observed not only in dedicated malware infrastructure, as well as legitimate websites which have been compromised to serve RIG EK or redirect to systems which contain the malware.  RIG Ek targets vulnerable versions of Adobe Flash (encoded with doswf) and Internet Explorer on the Windows operating system, but it is a modular framework where different exploits and payloads can easily be swapped in and out.  RIG currently delivers its exploits both in the landing page and in flash files. has also been observed targeting vulnerabilities in Silverlight, and Java in the past.  RIG EK is not as heavily obfuscated as some other EK’s. This is why you may see portions of it reused in other EK’s such as SunDown/Xer.
Valid RIG EK activity is typically observed from client endpoints connecting to internet based systems over HTTP connections.  Successful exploitation often includes observing several rules which progress from Redirector->Landing page->Exploit->Payload-> C2.
RIG EK contains several different components which may be observed, particularly when the exploit is successful:
Landing Page:  A redirector will route traffic to the RIG EK Landing Page which is a system that will evaluate if the user is a valid target, often by inspecting the user’s geolocation via IP address, User-Agent, and even running Javascript modules to identify if the system is running vulnerable software versions as well as blacklisted software.  The Landing Page rules look for identifiable aspects like URI and header structure.  A user is not compromised from this stage alone, but it is typically observed in the full attack chain. This tends to be a very minimal page invoking a flash file containing the exploits. 
Exploit:  The RIG EK leverages a number of different exploits across different software packages to ensure the greatest likelihood of success.  One or more exploits may be delivered in the same session.  Seeing an exploit does not necessarily mean that the client asset is compromised, if the system is patched or protected by security software / systems capable of detecting and protecting against the exploit, it may fail.  However, you should look for other indicators of compromised to validate the likelihood.
Payload:  While the exploit targets a vulnerability on the client system to gain basic execution control, the payload stage serves to deliver additional malware, configuration, and auxiliary packages to a compromised system.  Observing RIG EK Payload may not definitively mean that an asset is compromised, like exploits, it may be prevented, but these rules warrant additional investigation. These tend to be variable length XOR encrypted payloads. Additionally, there will be several metadata fields which we put into our rules to allow concise, portable, actionable decisions to be made both manually and by automation such as rule managers.

Name : **PDF With Embedded Adobe Shockwave Flash Possibly Related to Remote Code Execution Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Description : This signature looks for common fields in tech support phone scam landing pages. These pages will pop up windows attempting to social engineer a user into calling the scammer to "fix their computer". They use simple javascript and html alert window techniques to prevent a user from leaving the page without killing the browser. As the rest of the attack occurs over the phone, there is usually no automated way to validate that the user has called the scammer without reaching out to the user.

Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **DLL or EXE File From Possible WebDAV Share Possible DLL Preloading Exploit Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.


Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.


With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Possible Phishing Redirect Dec 13 2016** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.


Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.


When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:


(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later


Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.


The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 


Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **Suspicious HTML Script Tag in 401 Unauthorized Response (External Source)** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **JS Obfuscation - Possible Phishing 2016-03-01** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **DRIVEBY FakeUpdate - URI - /styles/javaupdate.css** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures indicate that a malicious event has been observed, typically associated with exploit kits or watering hole attacks. This traffic occurs as legitimate activity on the part of the user, they are browsing a website which happens to either be compromised or loads malicious content which is embedded from a third party such as malvertizing. The user’s web browser and installed plugins  are then subjected to an exploit kit which attempts to compromise their system.

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures historically includes activity from many exploit kits, including but not limited to:

Angler
Archie
Blackhole
Crimepack
Flashpack / Critx
Goon/Infinity
Magnitude
NeoSploit
Nuclear
Redkit
SPL
Styx
Sweet Orange

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures also includes activity from many exploit kits observed in use by APT groups such as Sednit and Scanbox. Generic signatures are also included in this category of signatures which involved an unsuspecting user being subjected to browser and plugin exploits as a byproduct of normal web browsing activity.

In order to determine if a machine is compromised, or if the signature is an FP/FN, you should look at other signatures that fire against the client endpoint to determine if you see a chain of activity.  Typically if an exploit is successful you will see activity such as redirectors, landing pages, exploits, and ultimately command and control traffic.  Seeing only a driveby signature may indicate that the endpoint was attacked, but it may not be fully compromised.  You can further review the offending web servers in ET Intelligence for further validation to see if they have malicious reputation.

Name : **DRIVEBY FakeUpdate - URI - Payload Requested** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures indicate that a malicious event has been observed, typically associated with exploit kits or watering hole attacks. This traffic occurs as legitimate activity on the part of the user, they are browsing a website which happens to either be compromised or loads malicious content which is embedded from a third party such as malvertizing. The user’s web browser and installed plugins  are then subjected to an exploit kit which attempts to compromise their system.

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures historically includes activity from many exploit kits, including but not limited to:

Angler
Archie
Blackhole
Crimepack
Flashpack / Critx
Goon/Infinity
Magnitude
NeoSploit
Nuclear
Redkit
SPL
Styx
Sweet Orange

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures also includes activity from many exploit kits observed in use by APT groups such as Sednit and Scanbox. Generic signatures are also included in this category of signatures which involved an unsuspecting user being subjected to browser and plugin exploits as a byproduct of normal web browsing activity.

In order to determine if a machine is compromised, or if the signature is an FP/FN, you should look at other signatures that fire against the client endpoint to determine if you see a chain of activity.  Typically if an exploit is successful you will see activity such as redirectors, landing pages, exploits, and ultimately command and control traffic.  Seeing only a driveby signature may indicate that the endpoint was attacked, but it may not be fully compromised.  You can further review the offending web servers in ET Intelligence for further validation to see if they have malicious reputation.

Name : **DNS Request to NilePhish Domain 01** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **DNS Request to NilePhish Domain 07** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **DNS Request to NilePhish Domain 24** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **Tech Support Phone Scam Landing Aug 10 M3** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Name : **Possible Adobe Reader and Acrobat Forms Data Format Remote Security Bypass Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Possible Adobe Acrobat and Reader Pushstring Memory Corruption Attempt** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Hex Obfuscation of substr % Encoding** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Potential Internet Explorer Use After Free CVE-2013-3163 2** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **DRIVEBY Social Engineering Toolkit JAR Download** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures indicate that a malicious event has been observed, typically associated with exploit kits or watering hole attacks. This traffic occurs as legitimate activity on the part of the user, they are browsing a website which happens to either be compromised or loads malicious content which is embedded from a third party such as malvertizing. The user’s web browser and installed plugins  are then subjected to an exploit kit which attempts to compromise their system.

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures historically includes activity from many exploit kits, including but not limited to:

Angler
Archie
Blackhole
Crimepack
Flashpack / Critx
Goon/Infinity
Magnitude
NeoSploit
Nuclear
Redkit
SPL
Styx
Sweet Orange

Emerging Threats “Driveby” signatures also includes activity from many exploit kits observed in use by APT groups such as Sednit and Scanbox. Generic signatures are also included in this category of signatures which involved an unsuspecting user being subjected to browser and plugin exploits as a byproduct of normal web browsing activity.

In order to determine if a machine is compromised, or if the signature is an FP/FN, you should look at other signatures that fire against the client endpoint to determine if you see a chain of activity.  Typically if an exploit is successful you will see activity such as redirectors, landing pages, exploits, and ultimately command and control traffic.  Seeing only a driveby signature may indicate that the endpoint was attacked, but it may not be fully compromised.  You can further review the offending web servers in ET Intelligence for further validation to see if they have malicious reputation.

Name : **Internet Explorer execCommand function Use after free Vulnerability 0day Metasploit** 

Attack target : Client_and_Server

Description : The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development.
Its best-known project is the open source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.
The Metasploit Project is well known for its anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework (MSF).
Shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is called "shellcode" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.

These alerts will fire when shellcode known to be part of Metasploit Project is detected traversing the network. This indicates active use of Metasploit Framework, and it will fire very frequently during a penetration test. If you see only one or two alerts, it may indicate the attacker has copied the shellcode from Metasploit. There have been a few examples of its use in APT campaigns for persistence and lateral movement. 1,2

Name : **Operation Huyao Phishing Page Nov 07 2014** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods. A whitepaper concerning modern phishing obfuscation methods can be found at https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Obfuscation-Techniques-In-Phishing-Attacks

Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.

With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Suspicious LastPass URI Structure - Possible Phishing** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Emerging Threats phishing signatures are designed to alert analysts to users who may have fallen victim to social engineering by entering their credentials into a fraudulent website.

Typically scammers will attempt to steal a victim’s account credentials through the use of a fake login page. In the attack, the actor crafts a fake login page and hosts it on a server they control. This server may be owned by the actor through compromise or it may be a typo squatted or fraudulent domain. The phisher will then embed the URL for this page or an HTML/PDF attachment with the URL in a phishing email. The email can be sent as part of a broad-based or highly targeted campaign, and typically uses a templated lure. Clicking the link will lead the user to a fake page that typically carries graphics and branding very similar to those of the legitimate account login page.

When the user enters their credentials in the fraudulent login page, attackers have several options for retrieving them:

(a) Emailed off with a PHP mail() function to some attacker controlled email address
(b) Posted to an external site
(c) Be stored in a text file on the same server where the phish lives, to be retrieved manually later

Of these options, the most commonly observed is (a), while method (c) is the least commonly observed. Cases have also been observed where phishing kits (that is, software that generates the phish) or services are sold or given away on forums, and these kits may have backdoors or may also mail off the stolen credentials to the creator of the phishing kit.

The user is frequently redirected to the real login page: to the victim, it will simply appear that their login failed to process and they will often attempt to login again. Alternatively a document or PDF may be shown to the user. 

Emerging Threats phishing signatures typically fall into a few categories. The first is the “landing page” signature. This indicates that a user has clicked on a link in an email and visited a webpage containing characteristics of known phishing templates. This is typically of low value to an analyst as there is typically no loss of information at this point. The second is the “success” signature which indicates that a user has given away their credentials. This is typically of high value to an analyst as there is evidence that credentials have been lost. The third category of phishing signatures involve methods that have been observed to be unique to a majority of phishing scams. This includes things such as redirects, notes left by authors, and common obfuscation methods.

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : Possible CVE-2017-0199 Activity Office Performing Discovery of Autolinked HTA.

The RIG Exploit Kit is a malware delivery framework, designed to  compromise targeted end-user client systems and install malware.  It first appeared in 2013 although it came from the Goon/Redkit/Sakura EK codebases. RIG EK is often observed not only in dedicated malware infrastructure, as well as legitimate websites which have been compromised to serve RIG EK or redirect to systems which contain the malware.  RIG Ek targets vulnerable versions of Adobe Flash (encoded with doswf) and Internet Explorer on the Windows operating system, but it is a modular framework where different exploits and payloads can easily be swapped in and out.  RIG currently delivers its exploits both in the landing page and in flash files. has also been observed targeting vulnerabilities in Silverlight, and Java in the past.  RIG EK is not as heavily obfuscated as some other EK’s. This is why you may see portions of it reused in other EK’s such as SunDown/Xer.
Valid RIG EK activity is typically observed from client endpoints connecting to internet based systems over HTTP connections.  Successful exploitation often includes observing several rules which progress from Redirector->Landing page->Exploit->Payload-> C2.
RIG EK contains several different components which may be observed, particularly when the exploit is successful:
Landing Page:  A redirector will route traffic to the RIG EK Landing Page which is a system that will evaluate if the user is a valid target, often by inspecting the user’s geolocation via IP address, User-Agent, and even running Javascript modules to identify if the system is running vulnerable software versions as well as blacklisted software.  The Landing Page rules look for identifiable aspects like URI and header structure.  A user is not compromised from this stage alone, but it is typically observed in the full attack chain. This tends to be a very minimal page invoking a flash file containing the exploits. 
Exploit:  The RIG EK leverages a number of different exploits across different software packages to ensure the greatest likelihood of success.  One or more exploits may be delivered in the same session.  Seeing an exploit does not necessarily mean that the client asset is compromised, if the system is patched or protected by security software / systems capable of detecting and protecting against the exploit, it may fail.  However, you should look for other indicators of compromised to validate the likelihood.
Payload:  While the exploit targets a vulnerability on the client system to gain basic execution control, the payload stage serves to deliver additional malware, configuration, and auxiliary packages to a compromised system.  Observing RIG EK Payload may not definitively mean that an asset is compromised, like exploits, it may be prevented, but these rules warrant additional investigation. These tend to be variable length XOR encrypted payloads. Additionally, there will be several metadata fields which we put into our rules to allow concise, portable, actionable decisions to be made both manually and by automation such as rule managers.

Name : **Apple Safari UXSS (CVE-2017-7089)** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.


Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.


With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.

Name : **Google Chrome XSS (CVE-2017-5124)** 

Attack target : Client_Endpoint

Description : WEB_CLIENT signatures are designed to alert on attacks against web client software, primarily attacks against web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  These exploit based attacks target vulnerabilities in the web browser which can be used to compromise an endpoint.  Most of the WEB_CLIENT signatures detect Javascript type attacks against client software.


Often times, these attacks can be seen in in use by Exploit Kits (EKs) to force a client to download malicious code as part of a drive by download attack.


With its liberal rules on use of whitespace, the lack of strict format, commonly leveraged Javascript obfuscation by legitimate websites, Javascript is a hard language to write signatures for.  These signatures have a medium confidence level on their own; however when observed with other Exploit Kit signatures, the confidence should be considered high, especially if the server is known to be malicious in ET Intelligence.
